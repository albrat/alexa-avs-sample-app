## About the project

This project provides a step-by-step walkthrough to help you build a **hands-free** [Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/avs) (AVS) prototype in 60 minutes, using wake word engines from [Sensory](https://github.com/Sensory/alexa-rpi) or [KITT.AI](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy). Now, in addition to pushing a button to "start listening", you can now also just say the wake word "Alexa", much like the [Amazon Echo](https://amazon.com/echo). You can find step-by-step instructions to set up the hands-free prototype on [Raspberry Pi](../../wiki/Raspberry-Pi), or follow the instructions to set up the push-to-talk only prototype on [Linux](../../wiki/Linux), [Mac](../../wiki/Mac), or [Windows](../../wiki/Windows).

*NEW!* - [Click here](../../wiki/Conexant2Mic-Raspberry-Pi) for instructions to build the AVS Prototype using a Raspberry Pi and the Conexant 2-Mic Development Kit for Amazon AVS

## What is AVS?

[Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/avs) (AVS) is Amazon’s intelligent voice recognition and natural language understanding service that allows you as a developer to voice-enable any connected device that has a microphone and speaker.

## What's new?

**January 30, 2017:**

The AVS java sample app has been updated with the following changes:

1. Added support for the SetEndpoint directive.  
[See sample code »](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/blob/master/samples/javaclient/src/main/java/com/amazon/alexa/avs/AVSController.java#L520)  
[Read the docs »](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system#setendpoint)      
2. Added support for the Settings Interface.  
[See the code »](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/blob/master/samples/javaclient/src/main/java/com/amazon/alexa/avs/AVSController.java#L371)  
[Read the docs »](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/settings)      
3. Added locale switcher (en-US, en-GB, de-DE) to sample app user interface.  

For information on how to update your client code, see [Preparing for Internationalization](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/preparing-for-internationalization) on the Amazon Developer Portal.  

**December 8, 2016:**

The AVS java sample app for Raspberry Pi has been updated for two changes:  

1. The sample app now supports GPIO triggers for use with the Conexant 2-Mic Development Kit for Amazon AVS. [Click here](../../wiki/Conexant2Mic-Raspberry-Pi) for step-by-step instructions.  
2. The sample app is now officially certified for media and music services.  

**October 6, 2016:**

How is this different from the [last Amazon Alexa Pi project](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-raspberry-pi/tree/79b7df7aaa4c5304446f59c0bd3ee2589b245115)? That's easy, two wake word engines are included with this project - [TrulyHandsFree](https://github.com/Sensory/alexa-rpi) from [Sensory](http://www.sensory.com/) and [Snowboy](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy) from  [KITT.AI](http://kitt.ai). When you're finished, you'll have a working voice-enabled AVS prototype.

## Important considerations

* The earcons associated with the sample project are for **prototyping purposes only**. For implementation and design guidance for commercial products, please see [Designing for AVS](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/content/designing-for-the-alexa-voice-service) and [AVS UX Guidelines](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/content/alexa-voice-service-ux-design-guidelines).

* Alexa Voice Service [Terms & Agreements](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/support/terms-and-agreements)

* **Usage of Sensory & KITT.AI wake word engines**: The wake word engines included with this project (Sensory and KITT.AI) are intended to be used for **prototyping purposes only**. If you are building a commercial product with either solution, please use the contact information below to enquire about commercial licensing -
  * [Contact Sensory](http://www.sensory.com/support/contact/us-sales/) for information on TrulyHandsFree licensing.
  * [Contact KITT.AI](mailto:snowboy@kitt.ai) for information on SnowBoy licensing.

* **IMPORTANT**: The Sensory wake word engine included with this project is time-limited: code linked against it will stop working when the library expires. The library included in this repository will, at all times, have an expiration date that is at least **120 days** in the future. See Sensory's [GitHub](https://github.com/Sensory/alexa-rpi#license) page for more information on how to renew the license for non-commercial use.
